# Welcome to Drømmeteamet: An Intervention Designed to Mitigate Imposter Syndrome Among CS Students

## Introduction
Welcome to the Drømmeteamet project! This project is aimed at developing a digital intervention to mitigate imposter syndrome among undergraduate computer science (CS) students working in collaborative teams. This repository contains the code and resources for the Drømmeteamet website, designed as part of our master's thesis.

The Drømmeteamet website is designed to foster awareness of imposter syndrome (IP), change negative thought patterns, facilitate open communication within teams, set realistic expectations and enhance familiarity among team members. 

The website can be accessed here: https://drommeteamet.netlify.app/

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drommeteamet.git``` 
``` cd drommeteamet```

Install dependencies:
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:
``` npm install``` 

Run the development server:
``` npm start```

The website should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
